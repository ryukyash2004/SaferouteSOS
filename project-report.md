# Project Report: SaferouteSOS

## 1. Project Overview

SaferouteSOS is a safety application designed to enhance personal security by providing real-time location sharing, an SOS alert system, contact management, and route history tracking. The application aims to offer users a sense of security and provide tools for quickly requesting help in emergency situations.

## 2. Key Features

*   **Real-time Location Sharing:** Allows users to share their live location with trusted contacts.
*   **SOS Alert System:** A prominent button to quickly send emergency alerts with location information to pre-configured contacts.
*   **Contact Management:** Enables users to add, edit, and manage a list of emergency contacts.
*   **Route History:** Tracks and displays the user's past routes, which can be helpful for retracing steps or providing information after an event.

## 3. Technology Stack

The project utilizes the following technologies:

*   **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express (implied for API endpoints)
*   **Mapping:** Google Maps API
*   **AI/ML:** Genkit, Google AI (for potential future enhancements or features like report generation)
*   **Other Libraries:** `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `lucide-react`, `react-dom`, `react-hook-form`, `tailwind-merge`, `zod`

## 4. Development Process & Architecture

The project follows a component-based architecture using React and Next.js, which allows for modular and maintainable code. The application structure is organized into logical directories for components, pages (app), hooks, and utility functions (lib). API services are likely handled in the backend (Node.js/Express) and interacted with by the frontend to manage data like contacts and route history. The inclusion of Genkit and Google AI suggests a forward-looking approach to integrating AI capabilities, potentially for features like automated incident reporting or route analysis.

## 5. Potential Future Enhancements

Based on the current structure and included technologies, potential future enhancements could include:

*   Automated generation of project reports or incident summaries using AI.
*   Integration with external emergency services APIs.
*   Advanced route analysis (e.g., identifying risky areas based on user history or public data).
*   Group sharing features.
*   Wearable device integration.
*   Offline functionality for location tracking.
